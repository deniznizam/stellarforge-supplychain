# StellarForge Finance — Stellar Soroban Supply Chain Finance dApp

StellarForge Finance is a production-grade, milestone-locked **Reverse Factoring / Supply Chain Finance** protocol built on Stellar (Soroban). It allows small Suppliers to secure upfront production capital backed by the creditworthiness and final repayment obligation of reputable Buyers. Capital is escrowed on-chain and disbursed stage-by-stage upon independent Oracle validation of physical delivery milestones.

## 🏗️ Project Architecture

The codebase has a decoupled, modular design divided into smart contracts and a web-based frontend:

```

## 🛡️ Smart Contract Mechanics & Payout Logic

1. **Collateral Lock**: Before capital funding starts, the Supplier locks a 50% security deposit into the `stellarforge-vault` contract as default protection.
2. **Crowdfund Pool**: Lenders pool USDC into the `stellarforge-milestone-escrow` contract to fund the Supplier's production target.
3. **Escrow Releases**: Escrowed capital is not disbursed all at once. As the Supplier completes milestones (e.g. procurement, cargo packaging) and uploads proof documents to IPFS, authorized validators approve the milestones in `stellarforge-oracle`, which triggers automated stage-by-stage payouts to the Supplier.
4. **Buyer Repayment**: Upon arrival of cargo at the destination port, the Buyer repays principal + 5% yield to the Escrow. Lenders retrieve their funds with interest, and the Supplier's Vault collateral is fully returned.
5. **Default Liquidation**: If the Supplier misses deadlines (monitored by the virtual ledger time), keeper bots can trigger default liquidation, distributing the Supplier's Vault collateral to protect Lenders.

## 🧪 Testing Suites

### 1. Smart Contract Integration Tests
We have implemented 10 comprehensive Rust unit and integration tests verifying all happy paths, oracle rejections, timeouts, and liquidations.
```bash
# Run all smart contract tests
cargo test --workspace
```

### 2. Frontend Unit Tests
We have integrated a lightweight, zero-dependency unit testing suite verifying translation consistency, component layout rules, and simulation state setups.
```bash
# Run all frontend tests
cd frontend
npm run test
```

## 🚀 Deployment Workflow

To deploy the contracts to the Stellar Testnet, initialize them, and configure inter-contract linkages:

### On Unix/Linux:
```bash
chmod +x deploy.sh
./deploy.sh
```

### On Windows (PowerShell):
```powershell
./deploy.ps1
```

## 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)
The repository is fully integrated with a GitHub Actions workflow. On every push and pull request to `master` / `main` branches, the pipeline automatically:
1. Runs Cargo check and executes the Rust unit tests.
2. Sets up Node.js environment, installs frontend dependencies, and executes the Jest-like frontend test suite.
3. Builds the production-ready Next.js application to verify compilation completeness.
